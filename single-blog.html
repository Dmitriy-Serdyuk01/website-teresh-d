                                    Amendments to the law on defense procurement have already entered into force. From April 24, customers in the field of defense began to publish information about prices and the subject of procurement.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine Nadiya Bihun said this on the air of the National telethon "Edyny Novyni".
                                    <br><br>
                                    "The public procurement system Prozorro has revealed information about the prices at which defense customers purchase goods for the military. We took into account the wishes that were voiced regarding security. Therefore, customers have the option not to publish sensitive information related to purchase volumes, places of delivery and information about suppliers. But the information that is important for society and for us, namely the price of what is purchased, will be published," said Nadiya Bigun.
                                    <br><br>
                                    According to her, clear deadlines for the publication of such reports have been established. Yes, within ten days from the date of payment under the contract, information on current purchases must be published, and by June 22, reports must be published on all old contracts that have been entered into since the full-scale invasion, that is, from February 24, 2022.
                                    <br><br>
                                    If the customers do not comply with this procedure, the authorized persons of such institutions risk receiving a fine for this.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The advantage of the new reporting system is that, at the same time, military secrecy is preserved, but society also receives information about the prices at which products are purchased.
                                    <br><br>
                                    "From the point of view of public control, it is not important to us how many conventional eggs were purchased. It is important for us to understand what the purchase price of one egg is. Because information on the amount of procurement can be used by our enemy in order to have more information about the number of military personnel in one or another part. If we find out that the purchase price raises questions, then we will contact the State Audit Service and ask for a deeper inspection," Nadiya Bigun explained.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Separately, the Deputy Minister of Economy focused on how the public procurement procedure changed last year.
                                    <br><br>
                                    “Since the start of the full-scale invasion, defense customers have been allowed to buy without procedures at Prozorro. Accordingly, they followed the path of concluding direct contracts. Since autumn, we have started to gradually return to normal procedures. Where there was no risk of leakage of sensitive information, where there was an opportunity to attract a wide market and through competition to get the best prices, we began to make framework agreements for defense needs.
                                    <br><br>
                                    That is, now in Prozorro you can see several dozen customers who have started purchasing, first of all, tangible property, through defense frameworks, and the number of such customers is growing. And I hope that during this year most customers will start to return to the Prozorro system. Because competition is the best way to get the most effective price," Nadiya Bigun summed up.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We will remind that the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine is working on the creation of a new framework agreement procedure for defense needs, thanks to which the defense forces will be able to conduct competitive selection of suppliers through the Prozorro system, and at the same time not publish sensitive information in the system.
